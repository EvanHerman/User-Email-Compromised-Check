# Email-Compromised-Check

### Inspired by all the API and security talks at WordCamp Philly 2015.

Simple WordPress plugin which cross checks registered user emails with the [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API for data breaches across a number of popular sites around the internet.


Simple, lightweight and free :)
