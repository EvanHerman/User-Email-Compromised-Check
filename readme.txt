Cross check registered user emails with the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ API for data breaches across a number of popular sites around the internet.

== Description ==
Simple WordPress plugin which cross checks registered user emails with the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ API for data breaches across a number of popular sites around the internet.

After seeing numerous talks on APIs and Security at WordCamp Philly 2015 the day before, I decided to write this plugin the next day for contributor day as another contribution to the community.

Simple, lightweight and free :)

== Installation ==
Upload the User Email Compromised Check plugin to your blog, Activate it and head over to the users page or the user profile page to begin cross checking emails.
